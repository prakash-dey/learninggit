                <p class="para1">The Battle of Heraklion was fought during World War II on the island of Crete between
                    20 and 29 May
                    1941. British, Australian and Greek forces defended the port and the airfield of Heraklion against a
                    German paratrooper attack. The German assault was launched without direct air support, and drops
                    occurred over several hours rather than simultaneously. German units dropping near Heraklion
                    (pictured) suffered very high casualties; those dropping further away were severely hampered by
                    Cretan partisans. The German attack failed. When it was renewed the next day it failed again. The
                    fighting then settled into a stalemate. A convoy of German seaborne reinforcements was intercepted
                    by a British naval squadron and scattered. The Germans refocused on the battle for Maleme airfield,
                    which they won, causing the Allies to evacuate. Commonwealth troops were taken off Crete by Allied
                    warships on the night of 28/29 May; at sea, two Allied destroyers were sunk and two cruisers badly
                    damaged, causing many casualties. (Full article...)</p>
